  **I've always been a t-shirt kind of guy.**

  Tees are a perk of living in a warm and mild city like Sydney, and some might say I'm a tad obsessed with the trusty old tee, especially those a grey persuasion.
  
  As I'm currently packing up two boxes of old tees to take to [Vinnies](http://www.vinnies.org.au/) in preparation for our move to Coogee Beach for the summer, it's only fitting that I drum up some tee purchasing excitement with the release of the official tee for the Web Directions South conference: **[tshirt09.webdirections.org](http://tshirt09.webdirections.org/)**

  ## The design

  It seems that I've replaced my habit of impulsive Threadless tee purchasing (I was there for the first print of [Flowers in the Attic](http://www.threadless.com/product/114/Flowers_in_the_Attic) man, I WAS THERE!) with a habit of dragging Carla in to design geek tees for every geek event I help organise. Last May I dragged her in, once again, to whip up a new design for the [Rails Camp tee](http://railscamptee.com/), and like all good things a new one-pager Sinatra app had to be built to pimp it: [railscampteev3.agencyrainford.com](http://railscampteev3.agencyrainford.com/).
  
  Maxine saw this shiny ordering process and asked if she could have a site just like it for a tshirt project for Web Directions.

  After some sketches and a couple of balsamiq mockups I had a pretty good idea of how I wanted it to work, the next step was to bust out some photoshop.

  The build was done with the trusty combination of [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/), [HAML](http://haml-lang.com/), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [fancyviews](http://github.com/quackingduck/fancyviews). Deployment and hosting is on the awesome that is [Heroku](http://heroku.com/).

  ## Embedding custom typefaces with @font-face

  Forget [image-replacement](http://www.mezzoblue.com/tests/revised-image-replacement/), [sifr](http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr/) and [cufon](http://wiki.github.com/sorccu/cufon/about)! [@font-face](http://webfonts.info/) has traction with most of the major browsers now (IE6+, Firefox 3.5+, Safari 3.1+, Opera, etc).
  
  I simply grabbed a couple of free fonts ([ChunkFive](http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/4-chunk) by [The League of Movable Type](http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/) and [zorque](http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/zorque/) by [Ray Larabie](http://www.larabiefonts.com/)), converted them to EOT for IE, and declared them via CSS:
  
  <pre><code class="css">@font-face {
    font-family: "ChunkFive";
    src: url("/chunkfive.eot");
    src: local("ChunkFive"), url("/chunkfive.otf") format("opentype"); }</code></pre>
  
  Using the font is as simple as:
  
  <pre><code class="css">h1 {
    font-family: "ChunkFive";
  }</code></pre>
  
  ![Custom typefaces](#{article_image_path(@article, "typefaces.jpg")})
  
  One of the many advantages to using <code>@font-face</code> is we get back all the standard webby things such as inline links and images.
  
  ## Motion blur with sprites
  
  The blurry tshirt effects were made using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)">sprites</a>.
  
  ![Sprites](#{article_image_path(@article, "sprites.jpg")})
  
  Above is the 5 frame sprite used to animate the male tee. At different stages during the animation I change the offset of the background image to give the effect of motion blur. I did try to get away with just 3 frames but adding an extra two meant I could go with more angle and blur.
  
  ## Decorating dom nodes with $$
  
  For the JS I used a [Yehuda Katz](http://yehudakatz.com/) and [Myles Byrne](http://github.com/quackingduck) inspired trick of attaching methods directly to DOM nodes using jQuery's <code>data</code> method.

  <pre><code class="javascript">// Decorates dom elements with methods
  $$ = function(elem, methods) {
    if (methods) $(elem).data("controller", methods);
    return $(elem).data("controller");
  }</code></pre>

  This allows you to construct an object model around the DOM, like so:
  
  <pre><code class="javascript">$(function() {
    var cut = $("#cut"),
        maleTee = cut.find(".m-tee");
    $$(cut, {
      show: function() {
        cut.show();
        maleTee.animate({left:"400px"});
      }
    });</code></pre>
  
  All the local variables are like instance variables, accessible through closure. To get a handle on the object with your custom functions you can use a selector:
  
  <pre><code class="javascript">$$("#cut").show();</code></pre>
  
  or if you've already got a jquery collection object you can call <code>$$</code> on it instead:
  
  <pre><code class="javascript">var cut = $("#cut");
  $$(cut).show();</code></pre>
  
  ## The final test
  
  In the end I'm pretty happy with the result, all that's left now is to see if it sells some tees.
